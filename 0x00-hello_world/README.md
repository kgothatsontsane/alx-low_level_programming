# C Programming - Hello, World :computer: :wrench:

## Project Overview :mag:

In this project, I will explore the fundamentals of C programming. This journey will include various tasks that will help me build a strong foundation in C programming.

## Learning Objectives :mortar_board:

By the end of this project, I aim to:

- Understand the Significance of C Programming: Gain insight into why C programming is considered an exceptional language with a rich history.
  
- Recognize C Programming Pioneers: Become familiar with influential figures in the world of C programming, such as Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds.
  
- Grasp the Compilation Process: Comprehend the compilation process when using the `gcc` compiler.
  
- Explore Entry Points: Understand the concept of an entry point in C programs and its connection to the `main` function.
  
- Print Text: Learn various methods to print text in C, including `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`.
  
- Determine Data Type Sizes: Calculate the size of specific data types using the `sizeof` unary operator.
  
- Compile C Programs: Gain skills in compiling C programs using the `gcc` compiler.
  
- Default Program Names: Familiarize myself with the default program name when compiling with `gcc`.
  
- Follow Coding Style: Adhere to the official C coding style and use the `betty-style` linter to assess code adherence.
  
- Find Correct Headers: Determine the correct header to include when using standard library functions in my code.
  
- Understand `main` Function: Grasp how the `main` function influences the return value of a C program.

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0-preprocessor       | Run a C file through the preprocessor and save the result to another file.                      |
| 1-compiler           | Compile a C file without linking it, generating an output file with a `.o` extension.            |
| 2-assembler          | Generate assembly code from a C file and save it with a `.s` extension.                           |
| 3-name               | Compile a C file and create an executable named "cisfun."                                        |
| 4-puts.c             | Create a C program that prints a specific message using the `puts` function.                    |
| 5-printf.c           | Develop a C program that prints a message with proper grammar using the `printf` function.       |
| 6-size.c             | Write a C program that prints the size of different data types on the computer.                   |
| 100-intel            | Generate Intel syntax assembly code from a C file and save it with a `.s` extension.              |
| 101-quote.c          | Create a C program that prints a specific quote to the standard error without certain functions. |
