# C Programming - Functions, Nested Loops :gear::loop:

## Learning Objectives :mortar_board:

By the end of this project, I aim to:

- Understand Nested Loops: Learn what nested loops are and how to use them.
  
- Master Functions: Comprehend what functions are and how to use them.
  
- Differentiate Function Declaration and Definition: Recognize the difference between declaring and defining a function.
  
- Grasp Prototypes: Understand what function prototypes are.
  
- Scope of Variables: Explore the scope of variables in C programming.
  
- GCC Flags: Learn the purpose of the GCC flags `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`.
  
- Header Files: Know what header files are and how to use them with `#include`.

## Tools Used :hammer_and_wrench:

| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-putchar.c                | Print `_putchar`, followed by a new line. Return 0.                                                       |
| 1-alphabet.c             | Write a function to print the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. Use `_putchar` only twice. |
| 2-print_alphabet_x10.c | Write a function to print the alphabet in lowercase 10 times, followed by a new line. Use `_putchar` only twice. |
| 3-islower.c             | Write a function to check if a character is lowercase. Return 1 if lowercase, 0 otherwise. |
| 4-isalpha.c             | Write a function to check if a character is alphabetic. Return 1 if alphabetic, 0 otherwise. |
| 5-sign.c                | Write a function to print the sign of a number. Return 1 for positive, 0 for zero, -1 for negative. |
| 6-abs.c                 | Write a function to compute the absolute value of an integer. |
| 7-print_last_digit.c    | Write a function to print the last digit of a number. Return the value of the last digit. |
| 8-24_hours.c            | Write a function to print every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, from 00:00 to 23:59. |
| 9-times_table.c         | Write a function to print the 9 times table, starting with 0. |
| 10-add.c                | Write a function to add two integers and return the result. |
| 11-print_to_98.c        | Write a function to print all natural numbers from n to 98, separated by a comma and space. |
| 100-times_table.c       | Write a function to print the n times table, starting with 0 (if n is valid). |
| 101-natural.c           | Write a program to compute and print the sum of multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024. |
| 102-fibonacci.c         | Write a program to print the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, separated by comma and space. |
