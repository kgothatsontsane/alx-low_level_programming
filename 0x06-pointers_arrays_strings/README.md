# C Programming - Pointers, Arrays, and Functions :computer: :wrench:

## Project Overview :mag:

This project involves creating various C functions to perform tasks related to pointers, arrays, and functions. It is an opportunity to deepen your understanding of these fundamental concepts in C programming.

## Tools Used :hammer_and_wrench:

- **Programming Language:** C
- **Compiler:** GCC
- **Development Environment:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Code Style Checker:** Betty (betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl)
- **Version Control:** Git

## Learning Objectives :mortar_board:

By the end of this project, you should have a good understanding of the following concepts:

- Pointers and their usage
- Arrays and their manipulation
- Differences between pointers and arrays
- String handling and manipulation
- Variable scope
