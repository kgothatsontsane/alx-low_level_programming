## Tasks :pencil:

| Task                                       | Description                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **0. Object-like Macro**                   | Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024. 📦 |
| **1. Pi**                                  | Create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359. 🥧 |
| **2. File name**                           | Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line. 📂 You are allowed to use the standard library. 📚 |
| **3. Function-like macro**                 | Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x. ⚖️ |
